Here is the fully customized Lesson 1, reflecting the necessary adjustments and corrections:

# Lesson 1: Introduction to Kotlin and Rust Interoperability

This lesson will walk through the creation of a basic Kotlin application that interacts with a simple Rust library, showcasing the setup of a Gradle project that includes both Kotlin and Rust code.

## Project Structure

- `LESSONS/LESSON_1/Kotlin/Main.kt`: The main Kotlin application file.
- `LESSONS/LESSON_1/Rust/src/lib.rs`: The Rust library source code.
- `LESSONS/LESSON_1/build.gradle.kts`: The Gradle build script for Kotlin.
- `LESSONS/LESSON_1/Cargo.toml`: The Cargo configuration for Rust.

## Prerequisites

- Install JDK (Java Development Kit) version 1.8 or higher.
- Install Rust and Cargo using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).
- Install Gradle and Kotlin.

## Steps

### Step 1: Setting Up the Kotlin Application

1. Inside the `LESSONS/LESSON_1/Kotlin/` directory, create a Kotlin source file named `Main.kt`.
2. Implement a simple Javalin server in `Main.kt` that listens on port `7080`:

```kotlin
import io.javalin.Javalin

fun main() {
    val app = Javalin.create().start(7080)
    app.get("/") { ctx -> ctx.result("Hello from Kotlin!") }
}
```

### Step 2: Setting Up the Rust Library

1. Inside the `LESSONS/LESSON_1/Rust/src/` directory, create a Rust source file named `lib.rs`.
2. Write a simple function in `lib.rs` that will be called from Kotlin:

```rust
#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn greet_from_rust() -> String {
    "Hello from Rust!".to_string()
}
```

### Step 3: Configuring the Gradle Build

1. At the root of the `LESSONS/LESSON_1/` directory, ensure your `build.gradle.kts` script is configured to compile Kotlin source files and also invoke `cargo build` for the Rust code:

```kotlin
plugins {
    kotlin("jvm") version "1.4.32"
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    implementation("io.javalin:javalin:3.13.10")
    implementation(kotlin("stdlib"))
}

// This task calls the Rust build command before compiling Kotlin.
tasks.withType<JavaCompile> {
    dependsOn("buildRust")
}

tasks.register("buildRust") {
    doLast {
        exec {
            commandLine("cargo", "build", "--release", "--manifest-path", "LESSONS/LESSON_1/Rust/Cargo.toml")
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 4: Building and Running

1. Use the command line to navigate to `LESSONS/LESSON_1/` and run the Gradle wrapper to build the project:

```bash
./gradlew build
```

2. Run your Kotlin application with:

```bash
./gradlew run
```

## Testing

Send an HTTP request to `http://localhost:7080` and confirm that you receive the "Hello from Kotlin!" message. To test the Rust integration, you will need to expand the Kotlin server to call the compiled Rust library and return its output.

By completing this lesson, you should have a fundamental understanding of how to configure a multi-language project that includes both Kotlin and Rust code, using Gradle to build and run the application.

Remember to adjust the paths according to the actual structure of your project and where the `build.gradle.kts` resides. It's important that the Gradle script is correctly set up to handle both Kotlin and Rust builds, calling the appropriate commands for each part of the project.
