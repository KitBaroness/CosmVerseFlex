1. The server does not have a route defined that corresponds to the requested URL.
2. The route exists, but the server isn't running or isn't reachable.
3. There might be a typo in the URL specified in the JavaScript code making the request.

# Lesson 3: Setting Up Server Endpoints and Managing Project Paths

Welcome to Lesson 3! In this lesson, we will walk through the steps of setting up server endpoints in your Kotlin project and understanding how to manage paths when working with multiple projects within a single repository.

## Server Endpoints with Kotlin and Javalin

To set up your server endpoints, you will need to define routes in your Kotlin application using the Javalin framework. Here's how:

### Step 1: Define Routes in Kotlin

Inside your main server file (e.g., `FlexNet.kt`), define the necessary routes:

```kotlin
app.post("/verify-user") { ctx ->
    // Your verification logic here
}

app.get("/get-indexing-results") { ctx ->
    // Your logic to retrieve and return indexing results here
}
```

### Step 2: Configure Static Files

Ensure that your static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) are accessible:

```kotlin
app.config.staticFiles.add("/static", Location.CLASSPATH)
```

Your `home.html` should be within the `/static` directory that you've referenced.

### Step 3: Check the Server Log

After starting the server, confirm through console logs that the server is up and running on the correct port:

```kotlin
logger.info("Application has started on port 8080")
```

## Managing Paths Across Multiple Projects

When managing a repository with multiple projects, it's essential to understand how paths work. Here are some guidelines:

### Step 1: Relative Paths

For relative paths, use project structure conventions. For example, if you have a common `libs` directory, you might reference it as:

```kotlin
val libPath = "../libs/myLibrary.jar"
```

### Step 2: Absolute Paths

Avoid using absolute paths. They are not portable and can lead to issues when the project is cloned into a different environment.

### Step 3: Classpath References

When referencing classpath assets, use the classpath:

```kotlin
app.config.staticFiles.add("/static", Location.CLASSPATH)
```

### Step 4: Dockerfile and Build Context

For Docker users, make sure that the Dockerfile is configured to copy over the necessary files into the image and that the build context includes all the needed files.

## Setting Up Docker for Server Execution

If your server is containerized, follow these steps to set up Docker:

### Step 1: Dockerfile Configuration

Ensure that your `Dockerfile` is configured to run your server. If you use an `entrypoint.sh` script, ensure it's present and properly configured in the build context.

### Step 2: Building and Running the Container

Build your Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t flexnet-application .
```

Run the container with port mapping:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 flexnet-application
```

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to set up server endpoints, manage paths across projects, and configure Docker to run your server. Happy coding!

```

Please note, for the actual Kotlin and Docker commands, you need to ensure that they're contextually correct based on your specific project setup and requirements. This guide assumes familiarity with Docker and basic shell operations.
