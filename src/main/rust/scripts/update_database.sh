# Database Indexing Scripts
# update_database.sh (This is hypothetical, assuming you need a script for this)
# Location: scripts/ or an appropriate directory based on your project structure.
# Purpose: Reads from DEDUP_DIR and updates the database with the new deduplicated data.
# Additional Configuration Files
# Cron job file (if using cron to schedule the indexing.sh script)

# Location: Depends on the system's cron configuration (e.g., /etc/cron.* directories or crontab -e).
# Purpose: Schedules the indexing.sh script to run at regular intervals.
# Database configuration file (if the database is used)

# Location: Could be within a config/ directory or defined as environment variables.
# Purpose: Stores credentials and connection details to the database.

# Load configuration
source /path/to/your/.env

# Define the directory containing deduplicated data
DEDUP_DIR="/path/to/dedup_data"

# Loop through deduplicated files
for file in "$DEDUP_DIR"/*; do
  # You would replace the following line with the actual command to update your database
  # This might involve calling a Rust program that knows how to update your database
  # Or it could involve running `psql` or similar tools with SQL commands to update your DB
  /path/to/rust/binary/that/updates/database "$file" && rm -f "$file"
